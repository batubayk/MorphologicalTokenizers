.SH NAME
hfst-guessify \- =Compile a morphological analyzer into a guesser and generator.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hfst-guessify
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR...] [\fI\,INFILE\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Compile a morphological analyzer into a guesser and generator.
.SS "Common options:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help message
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version info
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print verbosely while processing
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Only print fatal erros and requested output
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
Alias of \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.SS "Input/Output options:"
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR=\fI\,INFILE\/\fR
Read input transducer from INFILE
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\,OUTFILE\/\fR
Write output transducer to OUTFILE
.SS "Guesser options:"
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-default\-penalty\fR
Give penalty for skipping one
symbol of input (1.0 by default).
.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-do\-not\-compile\-generator\fR
When compiling the guesser, do
not compile a model form
generator.
.PP
All analyses in the morphological analyzer should have the form:
w o r d f o r m POS [GUESS_CATEGORY=CLASS] X Y Z ...
where POS is the part\-of\-speech tag, [GUESS_CATEGORY=CLASS]
is an inflectional category marker and X, Y and Z are inflectional
markers. The form of the inflectional category marker is fixed.
CLASS can be any string, which doesn't contain "]".
.PP
Using the option \fB\-d\fR will reduce the size of the guesser file by
approximately half, but may substantially increase the load time of
the guesser when generating model forms. If you only need to guess
analyses of unknown word forms, \fB\-d\fR has no effect on load time.
.PP
If OUTFILE or INFILE is missing or \-, standard streams will be used.
