    \section argument_handling Argument handling

    Transducer functions modify their calling object and return
    a reference to the calling object after modification,
    unless otherwise mentioned.
    Transducer arguments are usually not modified.
\verbatim
    // transducer is reversed
    transducer.reverse();
    // transducer2 is not modified, but a copy of it is disjuncted with
    // transducer1
    transducer1.disjunct(transducer2);
    // a chain of functions is possible
    transducer.reverse().determinize().reverse().determinize();
\endverbatim

    \section implementation_types Implementation types

    Currently, an HfstTransducer has four implementation types as
    defined by the enumeration ImplementationType.
    When an HfstTransducer is created, its type is defined with an
    ImplementationType argument.
    For functions that take a transducer as an argument, the type of
    the calling transducer
    must be the same as the type of the argument transducer:
\verbatim
    // this will cause an error
    log_transducer.disjunct(sfst_transducer);
    // this works, but weights are lost in the conversion
    log_transducer.convert(SFST_TYPE).disjunct(sfst_transducer);
    // this works, information is not lost
    log_transducer.disjunct(sfst_transducer.convert(LOG_OPENFST_TYPE));
\endverbatim

    \section creating_transducers Creating transducers

    With HfstTransducer constructors it is possible to create empty,
    epsilon, one-transition and single-path transducers.
    Transducers can also be created from scratch with HfstBasicTransducer
    and converted to an HfstTransducer.
    More complex transducers can be combined from simple ones with various
    functions.
    
    <a name="symbols"></a>
    \section special_symbols Special symbols

    The HFST transducers support transitions with epsilon, unknown
    and identity symbols.
    The special symbols are explained in documentation of datatype #String.

An example:
\verbatim

  // In the xerox formalism used here, "?" means the unknown symbol
  // and "?:?" the identity pair

  HfstBasicTransducer tr1;
  tr1.add_state(1);
  tr1.set_final_weight(1, 0);
  tr1.add_transition
    (0, HfstBasicTransition(1, "@_UNKNOWN_SYMBOL_@", "foo", 0) );

  // tr1 is now [ ?:foo ]
  
  HfstBasicTransducer tr2;
  tr2.add_state(1);
  tr2.add_state(2);
  tr2.set_final_weight(2, 0);
  tr2.add_transition
    (0, HfstBasicTransition(1, "@_IDENTITY_SYMBOL_@",
                    "@_IDENTITY_SYMBOL_@", 0) );
  tr2.add_transition
    (1, HfstBasicTransition(2, "bar", "bar", 0) );

  // tr2 is now [ [ ?:? ] [ bar:bar ] ]

  ImplementationType type = SFST_TYPE;
  HfstTransducer Tr1(tr1, type);
  HfstTransducer Tr2(tr2, type);
  Tr1.disjunct(Tr2);

  // Tr1 is now [ [ ?:foo | bar:foo ]  |  [[ ?:? | foo:foo ] [ bar:bar ]] ]

\endverbatim

        epsilon transducer, one empty transducer and one transducer
        that accepts any number of 'a's and produces an empty string

    printf("Error reading transducer: not valid AT&T format.\n"); }
fclose(ifile);
fprintf(stderr, "Read %i transducers in total.\n", (int)transducers.size());

Epsilon will be represented as "@_EPSILON_SYMBOL_@" in the resulting transducer.
The argument \a epsilon_symbol only denotes how epsilons are represented
in \a ifile.

        NOTE: If the transition symbols contain space characters,

HfstTransducer a_star("a",type);

empty.write_in_att_format(ofile);
fprintf(ofile, "--\n");
a_star.write_in_att_format(ofile);

    /** \brief A transducer that obligatorily performs the mappings

                       the right context.

        @param alphabet The set of symbol pairs that defines the alphabet
                        (see the example).

        For example, a transducer yielded by the following arguments
\verbatim

    /** \brief A transducer that performs an upward mapping \a mapping
        in the context \a context when the alphabet is \a alphabet.
        \a optional defines whether the mapping is optional.

        @param context A pair of transducers where the first transducer
                       defines the left context and the second transducer
                   the right context. Both transducers must be automata,
                   i.e. map strings onto themselves.
        @param mapping The mapping that the resulting transducer
                       will perform in the context given in \a context.
        @param optional Whether the mapping is optional.
        @param alphabet The set of symbol pairs that defines the alphabet
                        (see the explanation below).

        Each substring s of the input string which is in the input language
        of the transducer \a mapping and whose left context is matched
        by the expression
        [.* l] (where l is the first element of \a context) and
        whose right context is matched by [r .*]
        (where r is the second element in the context) is mapped
        to the respective
        surface strings defined by transducer \a mapping. Any other
        character is mapped to
        the characters specified in \a alphabet. The left and right
        contexts must
        be automata (i.e. transducers which map strings onto themselves).

        For example, a transducer yielded by the following arguments
\verbatim
context = pair( [c], [c] )
mappings = [ a:b a:b ]
alphabet = set(a, b, c)
\endverbatim
        would map the string "caacac" to "cbbcac".

        Note that the alphabet must contain the characters a and b,
        but not the pair
        a:b (unless this replacement is to be allowed everywhere
        in the context).

        Note that replace operations (unlike the two-level rules)
        have to be combined by composition
        rather than intersection.
